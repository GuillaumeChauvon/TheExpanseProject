# Introduction

The expanse project is meant to be a space RPG inspired from the sage "The Expanse" by James S.A Corey.

The story line is not found yet. But it will probably be to get rich and help people around the solar system. I do not intend to implement "the Rings" for the moment.

Gameplay will be around 2 phases :

- RPG gameplay (navigating between station and planet to do mission)
- Space combat gameplay

## Travel preparation

Before traveling between places in space you will need to check and manage your ressources. It will impact :

- Crew's Health
- Crew's Morale
  - --> Crew's efficiency
- Energy efficiency
- Potential human problems
- Potential technical problems
- Detection of threats
- Comms possibility

Preparation of the itinerary to optimized missions, time, ressources or be able to refuel if necessary.
It can be necessary to avoid ennemy zones.

## Reputation

System of reputation between faction Earth/Mars/Belt

- Better prices depending on the place you are.
- Others spaceship might help or attack you.
  - Can call help from allies and ennemies too
- Prime on your head. Wanted by some faction.
- Add possibility to fake your signature if wanted ??

# Space Combat Gameplay

During travel you will have to fight spaceship for your mission / for ressources / for war / or you will have to defend yourself vs Pirats / Military.
You can not win all fight and will have to dodge and run sometimes vs bigger/better spaceship.

For the moment, I will not implement it.
It will be handled either by

- algorithms
- point and click interaction (kinda command board fight)
